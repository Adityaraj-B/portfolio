            <p>
                I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student in my second year, passionate about crafting accessible and user-friendly web interfaces while honing my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy projects where I can blend design with thoughtful engineering to create engaging user experiences. I'm excited to keep expanding my knowledge, tackle new challenges, and contribute to the developer community through open-source.
